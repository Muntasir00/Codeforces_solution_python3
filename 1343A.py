Solution: If calculate the sum of the wrappers, it forms a GP:
2^0 * x + 2^1 * x + ...... 2^(k-1) * x = n
Applying the GP sum we get:
x * ((2^k - 1) / (2 - 1)) = n
x * (2^k - 1) = n
x  = n / (2^k - 1)
Hence n should be completely divisible by denominator (2^k - 1) to get an integer value of x. We iterate over values of
k starting from 2 and return the value  n / (2^k - 1) when n is divisible by (2^k - 1)
