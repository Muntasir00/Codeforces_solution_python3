Solution: Since we want maximum number of primes to represent n, we will use the smallest primes to build it. If n is
even, it would have n/2 2s. If its odd, we would replace the last 2 with a 3. Since we have to also give the number of
primes in the result (which is n/2), we append that to the result.
